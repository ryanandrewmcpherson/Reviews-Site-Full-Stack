      Review mouse = reviewRepo.save(new Review(categoryRepo.save(new Category("Computer Accessory")), "Logitech M705 Marathon Mouse","At an average price of only $20.99 plus tax the Logitech M705 Marathon Mouse (wireless) is a tremendous value! It offers an ergonomic thumb rest and a sculpted design allowing for comfortable placement of the right hand that doesn't produce discomfort or strain with time. It claims a 3 year battery life, which is insanely long and hard to test. It uses laser tracking which is better than the standard optical tracking mechanism and uncommon for this price segment for a wireless mouse. It comes with a universal reciever that can talk to other Logitech accessories as well as the mouse. It offers 7 customizable funcions ($3 each hehe), which is more than the acceptable number for this price range of mouse. It has equally sized right and left click buttons that are comfortable and easy to reach. It has a clickable scrollwheel that can also go to the left or to the right as separate functions. It has a toggle button for smooth or graduated scrolling. There are only a few downsides. It has two narrow buttons above the thumbrest that admittedly are not the most comfortable to press. Those default to forward and backward. It also feels a bit heavy, especially with the default scanning sensitivity. This is easily rememdied by downloading the Logitech Options application and customizing that feature. Once that software is set up there are a wide variety of function customization options available that can also be apllication specific. Overall it's a 9/10","/images/mouse.png",tagRepo.save(new Tag("Awesome!"))));
      Review backpack = reviewRepo.save(new Review(categoryRepo.findByName("Computer Accessory"), "Amazon Basics Travel Laptop Backpack","For $39.99 plus tax the Amazon Basics Travel Laptop Backpack is a great value, but it's not perfect. It has a padded back and shoulder straps which feel well made and secure, as well as a chest strap for to keep bouncing to a minimum. It has a loop at the top for hanging on a hook as well as handle with a rubber grip. It has a padded laptop compartment that fits laptops up to 17 inches. There are a few issues with this compartment. The opening to the laptop compartment is a side opening and not as big as one would like it to be. It's definitely a chore to get 17 inch laptops into the bag because of the size of the opening. The compartment does have a removable/adjustable support strap to go in the middle of the the laptop inside of it. Another questionable detail about this compartment is it has an acordion style file holder inside of it, which just feels unecessary and makes it all the more difficult to get those bigger laptops in there. Unfortunately the laptop compartment does not fold flat to comply with tsa regulations. The adjacent compartment doesn't zip all the way down to make this possible. In future versions of the backpack tsa compliance would be a nice addition. Going from the back of the backpack to the front, the next compartment after the laptop compartment is very tall but rather shallow, and it has a padded tablet pouch. The pouch should be sufficient for most tablets with screen sizes 10 inches and under. Notable tablets that it wouldn't fit are the Microsoft Surface Pro and the largest sized Ipad Pro. This I feel is a mistake, as purchasers of this bag are likely to be consumers of one of those popular tablets also. Moving forward again to the next pouch is a slightly shorter and narrower compartment that is much deeper but also collapsible thanks to adjustable straps. This would be a great pouch to keep a lunchox or textbooks in. This compartment also has a cellphone pouch that can fit even the largest cellphones on the market today as well as a covered cutout for headphone cords. Moving on to the front of the backpack there is a tiny zipper pocket maybe to put a small wallet in. Below there is a multi function compartment which has inside a notebook/planner pouch, a calculator pouch, an id pouch, a mesh accessory pouch (for erasers or pencil lead boxes or staples), writing utensil sleeves, and a detachable kechain. On the front of the backpack there loops for carabiners, keychains, luggage tags etc and accent padding that matches the padding on the back of the backpack. On each side of the backpack there are accesory pouches for things like a mouse, power adapter, rolled up mousepad, or display cables. They could also be used to put a wireless speaker inside as they have mesh portholes to let sound out. On the outside of the accessory pouches there are also water bottle pouches. This backpack throws in everything but the kitchen sink. It's spacious, versaitile, and inconspicous looking enough to be used for business purposes. Only inconsiderate technology pocket design, and lack of tsa regulation keep it from greatness. Overall, it's an 8/10.","/images/backpack.png",tagRepo.save(new Tag("Great!"))));
      Review sitnstand = reviewRepo.save(new Review(categoryRepo.save(new Category("Baby Toy")), "Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Sit-to-Stand Activity Center, Spin 'n Play Safari","At $79.99 plus tax, the price of the Fisher-Price 2-in-1 sit-to-stand Activity Center, Spin-N-Play safari seems high for a baby's toy but it is well worth it. My 5 month old son spends hours in it a day because there is a lot to keep him entertained. It has an adjustable seat, adjustable legs, and 8 different toys on it.  The seat can also be replaced with a spiral ramp to slide toys or cars or whatever down when the child outgrows the seat. This comes included with the activity center. For right now imagine the face of a clock and we will go around the activity center by o'clock addresses, with the toy in front of the child in the picture being six o'clock. The most important toy is a music box at six o'clock. It is made to look like an alligator. It has a tail that spins and makes a clicking noise as it spins. It has three buttons that each light up different colors. It has two modes, one mode that plays a song, and another that just makes different sounds for each key and plays a short tune every once in awhile to keep the child's interest piqued. The alligator music box also has two volume settings and an off setting. Moving counterclockwise around the activity center there is a mirror between 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock with a toucan sitting on some kind of basket on it. The mirror has green stripes to help the child imagine they are in the jungle. My son loves looking at himself in this mirror. Moving again counterclockwise there is a see-saw/teeter-totter toy at 3 o'clock that has a lion on one end and a zebra on the other. Between 2 and 3 o'clock there is a flower toy with a bee on it that has spinnable petals. At 12 o'clock there is a toy with a circle, square, and triangle pieces that fit in circle, square, and triangle cutouts. These pieces are made to look like a ladybug, a butterfly, and a snail and each have a ball underneath and can presumably be used to roll down the spiral ramp when the toy is converted for toddlers. This toy has felt grass around it. Between 10 and 11 o'clock there is a flower toy with a clear rolling ball with colored balls inside of it. At 9 o'clock there is a an elephant that spits fish out of it's mouth on a kind of track going into a puddle or fountain that it's standing. There is also a movable fish in this plastic puddle that makes loud clicking sounds like one of those percussion instruments from elementary school music class (Guiro). Finally, between 7 and 8 o'clock there is a giraffe that sits in a plane with spinnable propellers that also has a spinnable cloud underneath of it.  The smaller toys (mirror, flowers, and girafe in the plane) are location agnostic, they just have a clip that works in any 4 of the circular slots. The bigger toys can only go in one place. This toy has a lot of value. If one breaks down that $80, there are at least 10 items (the activity center, the 8 toys, and the ramp insert that replaces the seat), so it's only $8 an item which pretty reasonable for a durable kids toy. Overall, I would give this toy a 9/10.    ","/images/toy.png",tagRepo.findByName("Awesome!")));
